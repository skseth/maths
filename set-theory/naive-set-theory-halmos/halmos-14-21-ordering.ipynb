    "\n",
    "If X is a partially ordered set such that every chain in X has an upper bound, then X has a maximal element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof :\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let S = collection of all weak initial segments of X**\n",
    "\n",
    "For every element x of X, we can map it to its weak initial segment $\\bar{s}(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "x <= y => $\\bar{s}(x) \\subset \\bar{s}(y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We now convert our problem of finding a maximal value in X, to finding a maximal set in S, i.e. an initial segment which is not included in any other initial segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis on chains (every chain in X has an upper bound), now becomes the hypothesis that every chain in S has an upper bound (now ordered by inclusion).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let CC = collection of all chains in X**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every member of X is a subset of some  $\\bar{s}(x)$ in S. If C is a chain in CC ( a chain of chains), the U C is in CC, since it is also a chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis now changes : instead of saying each chain C has some upper bound in S, we can say that the union of the sets of C, which is an upper bound of C, is a member of X (i.e. is also a chain). \n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a nonempty collection of subsets CC of a non-empty set X with two properties : Every subset of each set is in X (including the empty set, which is a chain!), and the union of any chain of sets in X is in X (note that we are not talking of all unions, only of union of chains ordered by inclusion, which form a bigger chain). We have to show CC contains a maximal set.\n",

    "**Choice function f, and growth function g**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let f be a choice function on X.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want a way to grow chains in CC slowly, one at a time. To do that we define a function g as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "For each chain A in CC, we define A' as the set of all x in X, such that A U {x} is also a chain (and hence in CC). \n",
    "\n",
    "define g on X as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "g(A) = A U f(A' - A) if A' - A is not empty\n",
    "g(A) = A, otherwise.\n",

    "We have to find all A's for which g(A) = A - these chains are maxed out!.\n",

    "\n",
    "A tower is a subset T of CC such that :\n",
    "\n",
    "i) the empty set is in T\n",
    "ii) If A is in T, g(A) is in T\n",
    "iii) If C is a chain in T, then U A in C is in T\n",

    "We have at least one tower - CC itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the collection of all towers of CC, and consider their intersection T0. T0 is a tower. \n",
    "\n",
    "**T0 and Comparability**\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a set C in T0 to be comparable if for every set A in T0, C is either included in A, or vice versa. To prove T0 is a chain, we have to show every element in T0 is comparable. Note that comparable sets definitely exist - the empty set is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider any given comparable set C in T0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose A is in T0 and A is a proper subset of C. Then, g(A) must be a subset of C (this is like in natural numbers where we say if m < n, m must be in n). Because since C is comparable, either C is a proper subset of g(A) or g(A) is a subset of C. But in the former case we have at least two elements between A and g(A) which is not possible (the importance of growing A slowly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a collection U of all sets A in T0 such that A is a subset of C, or g(C) is a subset of A. Our intention is to show that this more restricted set is in fact a tower. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly U contains the empty set, since it is a subset of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second condition : if A is in U, g(A) is in U:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) A is proper subset of C - Then g(A) is a subset of C, hence it is in U\n",
    "ii) A = C. Then g(A) = g(C) is a subset of g(C) and in U\n",
    "iii) g(C) is a subset of A, then g(C) is also a subset of g(A) and hence g(A) is in U\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the third condition (the union of a chain in U belongs to U), this follows from the definition of U. Thus U is a tower. But U is a subset of the smallest tower T0, which means U = T0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**T0 is a chain**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have basically shown that if C is comparable, so is g(C). Given any C, for U as above. Then U = T0 means that if A is in T0, A is a subset of C, in which case A is a subset of g(C), or g(C) is a subset of A. Thus starting from the empty set, we can build up, using our trusted function g, a chain of comparable elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the comparable sets in T0. The empty set is comparable. If A is comparable, so is g(A). And the union of a chain of comparable sets is obviously comparable, since it is in T0, since it is just the largest of the comparable sets. Thus the comparable sets in T0 form a tower i.e. they exhaust T0 - every set in T0 is a comparable. Thus T0 is a chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since T0 is a chain, the union, say A, of all sets in T0 is itself a set in T0. But this means g(A) is a subset of A. This is only possible if g(A) = A. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrapping Up**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means there is no x in X such that we can make the chain A bigger. Since A must be a maximal chain in CC. Since every chain in CC is a subset of some $\\bar{s}(x)$ in S, there must be an a in X such that $A \\subset \\bar{s}(a)$. The chain A must contain a (otherwise g(A) != A). This a is unique, because if A belonged to some other $\\bar{s}(y)$, this would imply a <= y, which would again mean g(A) != A.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a is the unique element such that $A \\subset \\bar{s}(a)$, and is the promised maximal element.\n",

Hence, U C is a function and hence an upper bound of C. Thus every chain is bounded above. Hence there must be a maximal element, say, f. dom f = P(X) - {$\\emptyset$}. If not, then let A be a non-empty element of P(X). Then there are |A| functions which extend f which contradicts the statement that f is maximal. Thus dom f = P(X) - {$\\emptyset$}\n",

Now consider a chain in C. Take the union. Given any 2 elements of the union a and b, either a < b, a = b, or a > b. Thus this union is in C and an upper bound of the chain in C. Hence every chain in C has an upper bound => C has a maximal element => X has a maximal chain. Note that this does not mean it has a maximal element. \n",
