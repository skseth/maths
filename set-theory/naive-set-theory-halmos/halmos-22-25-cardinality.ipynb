    "# Cardinality - The Size of Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of counting is to compare the size of one set with another. It turns out that while ordinal numbers are useful step, they are not quite the right measure of the size. This is because while any set can be well ordered, we can well-order the same set in different ways. For example, we could order the natural numbers so that every odd number is greater than every even number - this will be the ordinal $\\omega2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a correct measure of size, we turn to the theory of cardinal numbers. The problem is to compare the sizes of sets without worrying about any specific order. The key concept in order was similarity. The key concept in comparing size is equivalence. Recall that two sets A and B are said to be equivalent ($A \\sim B$), if there is a one-to-one correspondence between them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Natural numbers are well-ordered - this is what makes induction work. Remember well ordered sets are totally ordered and well founded i.e. every subset has a minimal element. But induction will also work for any well-ordered set.\n",

    "In fact, this also works for a transfinite well ordered set which is not countable - i.e. enumerable as an integer indexed sequence. \n",

    "This is also true for any non-empty subset of the well-ordered set.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the difference from natural numbers is that an element may not have a unique predecessor. Note that every element of a well ordered set has a unique successor.\n",
    "Proof : Take the (unique) minimum element of all elements greater than any given element.\n",

    "Theorem [Induction on Well Ordering] Let (X,<=>) be a woset. Let E be a subset of X such that\n",
    "i) smallest element of X is a member of E\n",
    "ii) for any x in E, if every predecessor of x is in E, then x is in E\n",
    "Then E = x\n",
    "Proof: Suppose E != X. Then X-E has a minimum element x since it is non-empty, and this x is not the minimum element of X, which is in E. But any y less than x is in E => x is in E by (ii). \n",

    "Clearly a,b are not in Z. But Z itself is an ordinal, and hence an element of both X and Y. In fact Z = a, because every element less than a is in Z (by def of a), and every element greater than a cannot be in z, else a would be in Z, and a itself is not in Z => Z is the initial segment of a. Similar Z = b. This implies a and b are equal. But this would mean a belongs to Z - a contradiction.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Theorem: Any woset each of whose initial segments are isomorphic to an ordinal is itself isomorphic to an ordinal.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof : Since a is a woset, there is a unique isomorphism from a to an ordinal. In fact we know this ordinal is unique since a is a woset. Hence we can call this ordinal Z(a). Let $g_a$ be the unique isomorphism from a to Z(a).\n",

    "\n",
    "Since X_x has an o.i to both Z(x) and to  $(Z(y))_{g_y(x)}$, the two ordinals are o.i. to each other => they are equal. Thus, Z(x) is a proper subset of Z(y).\n",
