    "## Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "The most primitive concept in set theory is one of belonging / containing / member of\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom of Extension : Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same extension\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then define \"subset of\" $\\subset$ / \"includes\" $\\supset$\n",
    "\n",
    "All other axioms allow us to make new types of sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom of Specification : To every set A, and every condition S(A), there corresponds a set B whose elements are exactly those elements s of A for which S(x) is true\n",
    "\n",
    "Russell's Paradox : B = $\\{ x \\in A : x \\notin x \\}$. Question : Does B belong to A? No, as it creates a contradiction. Hence there is no set of all sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom : There exists a set => there exists an empty set $\\emptyset$ (by Axiom of specification)\n",
    "\n",
    "The empty set is a subset of every set - proved vacuously => given any set A, find an element of the empty set not in A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom of Pairing : Given any two sets there exists a set containing them => there exists a set containing only the two sets {a,b} - the unordered pair. The set {a,a} = {a} is called a singleton of a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom of Unions : For every collection of sets, there exists a set containing all the elements that belong to at least one of the sets => there is a unique set which contains only these specific elements.\n"

    "Disjoint Sets : Sets with empty intersection\n",

    "\n",
    "Symmetric Difference - $A \\Delta B = A \\setminus B \\bigcup B \\setminus A = A \\cup B - A \\cap B$\n",
    "\n",
    "Redefining Intersection : If we consider the intersection of a collection of subsets of a particular set E, we can now define intersection for all collections, including the empty set : $\\bigcap C = \\{x \\in E: x \\in X \\text{ for every} X \\in C\\}$. Now, $\\bigcap \\emptyset = E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom of Powers : For each set, there exists a set containing every subset of that set amongst its elements => there is a unique set containing only these subsets. This is called the Power Set of the given set.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(E) = 2^E = \\{ X : X \\subset E \\}$\n",

    "The intersection of powersets of some sets is equal to the powerset of the intersection - and the same holds for unions.\n",
    "\n",
    "E = U P(E), but P (U E) => E is a subset of P (U E), often a proper subset. In general, E is not a subset of its power set, though it belongs to the power set.\n",

    "An ordered pair of a and b (a,b) = {{a}, {a,b}}. a is the first coordinate, b is the second coordinate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Relation : A relation is a set of ordered pairs. We can write $(x,y) \\in R$ as x R y. The projection of R to the first coordinate is called the domain of R, and the projection to the second coordinate is called the range or co-domain of R.\n",

    "A partial order relation is one which is reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for any relation R, we can define a strict or a weak version of it by changing the reflexivity. The strict relation corresponding to R will be anti-reflexive, the weak one will be reflexive.\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivalence relation R in X induces a unique partition in X - a partition is a disjoint collection of subsets of X whose union is X. This is sometimes called X/R or X modulo R.\n",

    "Partial orders are in some sense the opposite, being anti-symmetric. Typically referred to as <=. A partially ordered set is a set along with a partial order in it. For every partial order, we can define a strict partial order which is anti-reflexive - this can be referred to as \"<\".\n",
