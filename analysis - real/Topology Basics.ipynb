If s is in A, the theorem is proved, and s must be maximum. So consider the case where s is not in A. Then consider an open interval (an open neighborhood) of s : (a,b) which contains s, a < s < b. We first show that (a,s) cannot be empty : If (a,s) is empty then a must be the supremum of A, contradicting our assumption than s is a supremum. Second, since (a,s) is not empty, it must contain a point of A, otherwise s cannot be the supremum again. So it follows that every neighborhood of s contains a point of A, and s is a limit point of A and belongs to $\\bar A$.\n",

The next points would be chosen not to be in the union of all the balls before them (such a point exists because X is not covered by finite no of open e-balls).

Then since A is limit point compact, A must have a limit point => around such a point we can form a series of neighborhoods of decreasing size (1/i) - this we can do because X is a metric space, and choose points of increasing index (we can do this since each neighborhood contains infinitely many points of A), so given any index n, we can always find a greater one. By definition of sequential limit, we see that the limit point of A is also the limit of a subsequence. \n",

U is open in Y and contained in X, so it is open in X, and hence open in Y'. If U contains p, then Y-U is closed, and as a closed subset of a compact space, it is compact. So h(Y-U) is compact => it is closed as Y' is Hausdorff => the complement, h(U), is open in Y'. $h^{-1}$ has the same property, so we can conclude h is a homeomorphism, being 1-1, continuous with a continuous inverse.

Similarly union of any number of open sets can be shown to be open. We can also prove that X is a subspace of Y, that Y is compact, and finally that Y is Hausdorff. To prove Y is Hausdorff we use local compactness of X. If x and y are two points in X, then there are disjoint open neighborhoods of x and y. Assume y = p (the extra point in Y).

    "Proof(2): Assume there are two limit points a and b, with two disjoint open sets U and V around them. Then there are only finitely many points of the sequence outside of each - and this number cannot be zero since each of U and V contains at least one point, being limits of the sequence. Thus $U^c$ and $V^c$ contain finitely many points of the sequence i.e. $U^c \\cup V^c$ also contains only finitely many points. This implies that $(U^c \\cup V^c)^c = U \\cap V$ contains all but a finite number of points of the sequence i.e. it is not empty, contradicting our original assumption.\n",

    "Proof: Given any two points a and b, consider the sequence {b, a, a, ...}. If any open set containing a contained b, then both a and b would be limits. Since this is not possible, the limit can only be a i.e. there is an open set containing a but not b. Similarly, we can prove the other way.\n",

Taken n neighborhoods of x, each not containing one of the points - their intersection is open (since finite intersection of open sets is open), so we have an open neighborhood of x containing no point of A.\n",

Assume f(A) = {x}, We have to prove f(closure of A) = {x}: Since Y is T1, and {x} is closed, $f^{-1}({x})$ is a closed set containing A, and hence containing the closure of A.

Then, take x, not in A, such that $f_1(x) = a$, and $f_2(x) = b$, a and b being distinct. Now since Y is a Hausdorff space, then we can find open sets U and V as open neighborhoods of a and b, which are disjoint, and whose pre-images $f^{-1}(U)$ and $f^{-1}(V)$ both contain x and are open. The intersection of these is an open set containing x - and since A is dense it contains at least one point, say y, of A. But y would be in both pre-images i.e f(y) = a and f(y) = b which is not possible.\n",

Do it like in the previous proof, taking x being in B, but not A i.e. x is a limit point of A - then $f^{-1}(U)$ and $f^{-1}(V)$ both contain x and are open.

Let x be a point in closure of P, but not in P i.e. x is a limit point of P, and f(x) = y, say. Then there are disjoint open neighborhoods of x and y - say U and V. Since x is a limit point of P, every neighborhood of x contains points of P, whose image lies in P. Now $f^{-1}(V) contains x => there is an open neighborhood of x in f^{-1}(V). But this neighborhood would contain a point of P, which means the value of such a point is not equal to itself - a contradiction. So P must be closed i.e. f(x) = x and x must be in P.\n",
