Now, for any two intersecting disks, choose a point in their intersection, plus choose the the end points f(a) and f(b) (f being the mapping for the path). Then, we have a finite number of points in the path order them by increasing value of the parameter. Each successive pair of points must be in a common open disk from the finite cover. e.g. given f(a) either there is a point (at least f(b)) - other wise there is an open set in the open cover disjoint from the rest, and then we can see that the path is covered by disjoint open sets i.e. is disconnected, which is not possible. So the open set containing f(a) must contain another point in another intersecting disk. We can then break this into a horizontal and vertical section, and repeat this by induction for all points selected from the intersections.\n",
