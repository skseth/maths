    "First: Given a force of type Adx + Bdy + Cdz, let $X = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}$. The distance from (0,0,0) to (A/X, B/X, C/X) is unit distance. And the work done in moving this distance is $X = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}$ = magnitude of the force.\n",

    "A central force field on a large body in the solar system is directed towards the sun and inversely proportional to square of distance from the sun. Let the sun be at (0,0,0) and the body at (x,y,z). Since the force is acting radially, a particle at (x,y,z) would be moved to (x+cx,y+cy,z+cz) i.e. in the radial direction. From the previous section we see that such a force would have the form cxdx + cydy + czdz. The magnitude of such a force would be $c\\sqrt{x^2+y^2 +z^2} = cr$. But we know that $cr = k/r^2$ i.e. $c = k/r^3$. Hence the form of the central force field is :\n",

From the last section in constant forms, we have seen that if an item in a flow moves from (x,y) to (x + At, y + Bt), the flow has the form Ady - Bdx. So here the flow has the form cxdy - cydx. The magnitude is $cr = k/r$. So we get the form as :\n",

But it is easy to see that if the initial points are on the same sphere, so are the final points on another, large sphere. So flow out of first sphere = flow out of second sphere => flow is inversely proportional to square of radius. As in 2.1-1, we conclude the form of the force is :\n",
