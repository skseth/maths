Commutativity, associativity, identity and additive inverse follow immediately. Similarly, scalar multiplication properties also follow so the subspace is a vector space.\n",

The number of subspaces is finite. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one $U_j$, j != 1, must contain $v + k_1u$ and $v + k_2u$, where $k_1$ and $k_2$ != 0. But we can then, by taking inverses, and linear combinations, immediately see that both y and x must belong to $U_j$. Thus $U_1 \\subset U_j$. Hence, $V = \\cup_{i=2}^{n} U_i$. Continuing in this fashion we will always reach one set which contains all the others - either in the middle, or the last one remaining.\n",
