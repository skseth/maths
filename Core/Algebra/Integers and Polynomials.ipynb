    "# Binary Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary operation on a set (often denoted by +, . or some other symbol, is a function that takes two elements of a set and produces another element of the set. Instead of using the function notation, binary operations are often defined using infix notation. \n",

    "A binary operation * over a set A may (or may not) have the following properties :\n",

    "Commutativity : a * b = b * a\n",

    "Identity : There is at least one element e such that a * e = a for all a. Since it follows that \n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse : For every a, there is a b such that a * b = 0 - b is called a right inverse of a. If b * a = 0, b is called a left inverse of a. \n",

    "Associativity : a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c\n",
    "\n",
    "Closure: A subset S of the set A may be such that given a and b in S, a * b is also in S. Then * is said to be closed in S - the property of being closed on a set is called closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cancellation : a*c = b*c => a = b is called the right cancellation property. Similarly we have the left cancellation property. "
