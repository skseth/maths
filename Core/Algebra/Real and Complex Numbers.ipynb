    "We construct R from Q - each member of R is a \"cut\". A cut is a non-empty proper subset C of Q, such that \n",
    "a) if p is in C, and q < p, then q is in C. b) C has no largest member. Using this construction, we identify each point in R with a cut. We can then show that R is an ordered field, and has the least upper bound property. By association each member of Q with a cut, we can show that R contains Q as a sub-field.\n",
    "\n",
    "R has the order and metric topology and they are equivalent. \n",
    "R is a Hausdorff space - any two points can be separated by disjoint open sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Dedekind Completeness Property or the Least Upper Bound Property**: Suppose S is a nonempty subset of R that is bounded above. Then S has a least upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the Heine-Borel Theorem, any closed (bounded) interval \\[a,b\\] in R is compact. This result depends on the fact that R is an ordered set with the least upper bound property (but not on dense order).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Archimedean Property**: For every x,y in R, with x > 0, there is an integer n such that nx > y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: We can show that if there was no such integer n, then we could create a sequence of numbers in R which are bounded above by y, and hence have a least upper bound, say a. Then, (a - x) < mx for some m => a < (m+1)x, a contradiction, since a is an upper bound of all nx.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q is dense in R. Hence R has dense ordering.** : If x < y in R, then there is a $p \\in Q$, such that x < p < y. Thus given any two real numbers x and y, there is always a real number between them.\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "y - x > 0.  \n",
    "n(y - x) > 1, for some n (using Archimedean Property)\n",
    "-m1 < nx < m2, for some m1, m2, (using Archimedean Property)\n",
    "m - 1 < nx < m, for some m, such that -m1 <= m <= m2 (only finite no of integers bet -m2 and m1)\n",
    "Hence, nx < m < 1 + nx < ny => x < m/n < y\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus Q is dense in R. It follows that given any two distinct real numbers x and y, there is always a real number between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the other definition of dense (topology) is that a set is dense in a space if its closure is the entire space. For Q, every point in R has a neighborhood containing a point of Q (by the above proof). Hence Q is dense in R in that sense as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For every real x > 0, and integer n > 0, there is one and only one real y such that $y^n = x$. If a and b are positive real numbers and n is a positive integer, then $(ab)^{1/n} = a^{1/n}b^{1/n}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Cut Property** Suppose A and B are nonempty disjoint subsets of R whose union is all of R, such that every element of A is less than every element of B. Then there exists a \"cutpoint\" c of R, such that every x <= c for every x in A, and y >= c for every y in B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: x <= sup A <= y for every x in A and every y in B. sup A exists by the least upper bound property.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Topological Connectedness**: There is no separation of R i.e. no two non-empty, disjoint open sets whose union is R.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact every interval, and ray in R is connected. This follows immediately from the fact that R is a linear continuum, and hence is connected, as proved in the section on connectedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof (Alternative): If there was such a partition into two open sets A and B - these are also closed. Choose a from A and b from B, such that a < b (wlog). Then, Let S = {x : x in A and \\[a,x\\] is in A}. S is bounded above by b, so it has a supremum s (**least-upper-bound property**), which must be in A because A is closed, and the supremum of a set belongs to its closure (because of order topology).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact $s \\in S$, because otherwise \\[a,s\\] has some intersection with B containing a point t. (We have to show there are no points of S between t-e and s, leading to a contradiction that s is the supremum.) Since B is open, the interval (t - e, t + e) of this intersection is entirely in B. But this means a < t-e (since a is not in B), and t - e < t < s. So if s the supremum, there must exist an x in S, such that t - e < t+e <= x < s. This means that x is in a, and \\[a,x\\] is entirely in A, but this is not possible given t is not in A, and t lies between a and x. Thus s must be in S.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then, since A is open, (s - d, s + d) must be in A. Since R has dense order, there must be a point z of A between s and s + d. But then, since \\[a,z\\] = \\[a,s\\] U (s,z] is entirely in A, z belongs to S and s cannot be the supremum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Intermediate Value Property** If f is a continuous function from \\[a, b\\] to R, with f(a) > 0 and f(b) < 0, then there exists c in (a,b) with f(c) = 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: A = \\[a,b\\] is connected, as R is a linear continuum. And R is ordered. So ,since f(a) > 0 > f(b), by the Intermediate Value Theorem there must be a point c in \\[a,b\\], such that f(c) = 0. If it isn't then we would have a separation of f(A) and the image of a connected space is connected under a continuous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Bounded Value Property**: If f is a continuous function from \\[a, b\\] to R, there exists B in R with f(x) ≤ B for all x in \\[a,b\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: A = \\[a,b\\] is compact. Since f is continuous, f(A) is compact in R. Thus f(A) is also closed and bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Extreme Value Property**: If f is a continuous function from \\[a, b\\] to R, there exists c in \\[a,b\\] with f(x) ≤ f(c) for all x in \\[a,b\\] (similar is true for minimum). \n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: A = \\[a,b\\] is compact, and f is continuous, R is ordered, so by the the extreme value theorem, f(A) achieves its maximum and minimum. Simply, image f(A) is compact and any compact set in an ordered set has a maximum and minimum element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Shrinking Interval Property**: Suppose I1 ⊇ I2 ⊇ . . . are bounded closed intervals in R with lengths decreasing to 0. Then the intersection of the In’s is nonempty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Nested Interval Property**: Suppose I1 ⊇ I2 ⊇ ... are bounded closed intervals in R. Then the intersection of the In’s is nonempty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Both the properties above follow from the theorem that a collection of compact sets having the finite intersection property must have a non-empty intersection (an empty intersection would imply an open cover with no finite subcover). \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Convergence of Bounded Monotone Sequences**: Every monotone increasing (or decreasing) sequence in R that is bounded converges to some limit.\n",
